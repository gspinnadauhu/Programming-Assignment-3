#The data for this assignment come from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov)
#run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data and
#information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. This dataset essentially
#covers all major U.S. hospitals. This dataset is used for a variety of purposes, including determining
#whether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality care to patients (see http://goo.gl/jAXFX
#for some background on this particular topic).
